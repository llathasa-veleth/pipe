## Description

### TL;DR

This is a simple _pipe_ generator thingy just for fun.

## Making it works

### Building requirements
- Go

And nothing else is needed.

### Testing

```sh
go run pipes.go
```

### Building

```sh
git clone https://github.com/llathasa-veleth/pipes
cd pipes
go build
```

### Running

```sh
pipes --help  # seek for help
pipes         # run with default style
pipes -s thin # run with <thin> style
```

## TODO

- Makefile
- More options/flags
- Releases
